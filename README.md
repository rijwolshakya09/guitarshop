# Guitar Shop

## Project Description
Guitar Shop is an e-commerce app which is based on an actual guitar shop where customers can buy guitars according to their choices of different varieties. The app consists of different categories of guitars like acoustic, semi-acoustic, bass, electric and ukulele from where users can pick their favourite guitars. The app is very user friendly since it is an e-commerce app and everyone knows how to use it. The app consists of two users named customers and admin. Customers can see various categories of guitars, their profile whereas admin can add different categories of guitars and guitars according to their category. The app is made using flutter dart as it`s programming language coded in Visual Studio Code and backend using API, MongoDB.

## Features of App:
1) Customers can register and login into the app.
2) Customers can see the location of physical guitarshop present.
3) Customers can select any guitars of any category they want present in the website.
4) Customers can add guitars to their cart. 
5) Customers can add guitars to their wishlist. 
6) Customers can order their guitars from the website. 
7) Customers can read blogs about the guitars in the website. 
8) Customers can write review about the guitars on respective guitars page. 
9) Customers can cancel and delete their order from their order history. 
10) Customers can search for their desired guitars. 

## Technologies Used:
The technologies that were used to build as follows below:

1) Flutter: 
Flutter is an open-source software development kit which enables smooth and easy cross-platform mobile app development. You can build high quality natively compiled apps for iOS and Android quickly, without having to write the code for the two apps separately. All you need is one codebase for both platforms.

2) NodeJS: 
Node.js is easily employed as a server-side proxy where it can handle a large number of simultaneous connections in a non-blocking manner. It’s a light, scalable and open-source language platform which makes it very easy to build apps even at the enterprise level also. Overall it increases the efficiency of the development process as it fills the gap between frontend and backend applications. 

3) MongoDB: 
MongoDB uses documents that can contain sub-documents in complex hierarchies making it expressive and flexible. MongoDB can map objects from any programming language, ensuring easy implementation and maintenance. It is schema-less. Native aggregation allows users to extract and transform data from the database. The data can either be loaded into a new format or exported to other data sources. The user can selectively index some parts of each document or a query based on regular expressions, ranges, or attribute values, and have as many properties per object as needed by the application layer.

4) Express: 
Express is a node js web application framework that provides broad features for building web and mobile applications. It is used to build a single page, multipage, and hybrid web application. It's a layer built on the top of the Node js that helps manage servers and routes.

## Challenges:
The challenges that I encountered while developing this application are as follows:
1) Project consumed alot of memory and the system became very slow and it was very tough to run our applications. 
2) While getting used to designing, I faced lot of troubles of which widget I should use to make better designs and how should I use them. 
3) While Displaying Products or Other Things through API, I faced lots of problems of response and API where the error of Null Check Operator Kept Appearing. 
4) Other Errors such as path error, status code error kept appearing and it was hard for me to implement other systems such as online payment system. 

## Future Works:
1) Online Payment System Will Be Implemented Such As eSewa, Khalti, etc.
2) Login From Google and Facebook will be implemented. 
3) Order Tracking of Products Will be Implemented. 
4) Other Items Such As Guitar Equipments Will Be Added. 

## MVVM Design Pattern
MVVM stands for Model, View, ViewModel which is industry-recognized software architecture pattern that overcomes all drawbacks of MVP and MVC design patters. It suggests separating the data presentation logic from the core business logic part of the applications.

The separate code layers of MVVM are:

1) Model:
This holds the data of the application. It cannot directly talk to the View. Generally, it’s recommended to expose the data to the ViewModel through Observables.

2) View: 
It represents the UI of the application devoid of any Application Logic. It observes the ViewModel.

3) ViewModel:
It acts as a link between the Model and the View. It’s responsible for transforming the data from the Model. It provides data streams to the View. It also uses hooks or callbacks to update the View. It’ll ask for the data from the Model.

## Conclusion
At last, Guitar Shop an e-commerce app was created and developed using different types of technologies. The app is user friendly and has lots of features that an e-commerce site should have. The app was tested in physical devices like Android devices with sensors and also tested in wearables and shown responsive in tablets. The Guitar Shop app is created for geniune Guitar Shop which will allow users to buy guitars according to their categories and choices. They can directly buy the guitars and order them to their shipping address.
